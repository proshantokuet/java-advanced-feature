## Annonymous class 
Annonymous class is a inner class without a name. A nested class without name is called anonymous class.
It is an inner class without a name and for which only a single object is created.

## Difference between regular class(normal classes) and Anonymous Inner class:

1. A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but the anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time.
2. A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interfaces simultaneously. But anonymous Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
3. For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we canâ€™t write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because the anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor
class name and constructor name must be same.

#functional interface
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method and any number of static and default methid.
Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces. 


# Lamda
lamda experession is enhancement of anonymous class.
We can reduce the code using lamda expression.
Lamda expression is a clean and concise way of implementing of single method interface.
