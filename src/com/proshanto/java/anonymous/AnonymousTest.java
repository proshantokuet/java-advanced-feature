/**
 * Annonymous class is a inner class without a name
 * A nested class without name is called anonymous class.
 * 
 *  It is an inner class without a name and for which only a single object is created.
 *  Difference between regular class(normal classes) and Anonymous Inner class:
 *   1. A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but the anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time.
 *   2. A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interfaces simultaneously. But anonymous Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time.
 *   3. For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we canâ€™t write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because the anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor
 *   class name and constructor name must be same.
